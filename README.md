# 8-RGB-LED-CUBE
Ever since I saw Malt Whiskey's 16x16x16 cube in undergrad, I've wanted to create my own version of a led cube.
This repo will document my journey through the process. Feel free to use my replicate my design and create it yourself.

Purchases:
500+ 8mm WS2812 RGB LED (Aliexpress)
0.6mm diameter steel wire
Teensy 4.1 (I chose this because of the its super fast clock of 600Mhz)
TXS0108E (You will need to level shift the voltage from 3.3V to 5V to properly send signals to the LEDs)
Power Supply (Still searching, but will need to progress further to think about this componenet).
